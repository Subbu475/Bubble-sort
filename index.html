                <h2>What is Bubble Sort?</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Bubble Sort</strong> is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through
                    the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This
                    process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, meaning the array is sorted.
                </p>

                <h3>How Bubble Sort Works</h3>
                <p>
                    Bubble Sort compares pairs of adjacent elements, starting from the beginning of the array. If the
                    first element is greater than the second, they are swapped. This process is repeated for each pair
                    in the array. After each pass through the array, the largest element "bubbles" up to its correct
                    position at the end.
                </p>

                <h3>Step-by-Step Process:</h3>
                <ul id="steps">
                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Compare the first two adjacent elements of the array.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Swap them if the first element is greater than the second.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Move to the next pair of adjacent elements and repeat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Continue the process until the entire array is sorted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> After each pass, the largest unsorted element is guaranteed to be in
                        its correct final position.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Characteristics of Bubble Sort:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is an <strong>O(nÂ²)</strong> algorithm, meaning its performance degrades quickly as the size
                        of the array increases.</li>
                    <li>It is simple and easy to understand, but inefficient for large datasets.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Visualizing Bubble Sort</h3>
                <p>
                    As the algorithm runs, you will see comparisons and swaps happening in real time, and the largest
                    element at each pass will be highlighted in green, indicating it's in its correct position.
